# Cordic_DAC_Digital_Oscilloscope
Designed and implemented a sine waveform generator using the CORDIC algorithm and the  BASYS3 FPGA. The design was able to generate sine and cos waveforms with a wide range of frequencies and high  accuracy. The resource usage of the design was well within the constraints of the BASYS3 board. The design can be  further optimized and customized.
